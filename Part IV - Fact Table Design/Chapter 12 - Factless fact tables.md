# Chapter 12 - Factless fact tables
Paradoxically, a fact table does not always require facts to measure a process (Factless fact table). There are two situations where even though no facts are explicitly recorded in a factless fact table, it does support measurement: Factless fact tables for events and Factless fact tables for conditions.

- Factless fact tables for events record the occurrence of activities. Examples include the number of documents processed or approved, the number of calls to a customer support center, or the number of impressions of an advertisement.

- Factless fact tables for conditions are used to capture significant information that is not part of a business activity. Conditions associate various dimensions at a point in time. When compared with activities, they provide valuable insight. Examples of conditions include eligibility of people for programs, the assignment of salesreps to customers, active marketing programs for a product, or special weather conditions in effect.
