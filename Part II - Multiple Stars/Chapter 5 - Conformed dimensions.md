# Chapter 5 - Conformed dimensions
This chapter focuses on insuring cross-process capability through conformed dimensions. With the right dimension design and content, it is possible to compare facts from different fact tables, both within a subject area and across the enterprise. Conformed dimensions can do more than enable drilling across. They can serve as the
focus for planning enterprise analytic capability. 

## The Synergy of Multiple Stars

- New stars afford insights into a new business process and allows to be studied in conjunction with existing ones.
- Every business has chains of linked processes, often beginning with product development or acquisition, extending through customer acquisition, and culminating in the collection of revenues.
- Within a subject area such as sales, for example, there may be a series of linked processes (product manufacturing, sales, marketing, customer support, and finance).
- At a logical level, when a series of stars share a set of common dimensions, the dimensions are referred to as conformed dimensions.
