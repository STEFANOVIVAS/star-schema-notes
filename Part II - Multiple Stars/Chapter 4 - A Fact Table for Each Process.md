# Chapter 4 - A Fact Table for Each Process

It is rare to find a subject area that can be fully described by a single fact table. This chapter presents techniques you can use to determine when you are dealing with multiple processes, and explains the implications of not describing them in separate fact tables. While analysis of individual processes is useful, some of the most powerful analytics cross process boundaries. In a dimensional environment, this will require combining information from more than one fact table (Drill across).
